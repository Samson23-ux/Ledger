"""One-shot queue declaration.

Celery only asks the broker to create a queue when some worker actually
consumes from it (`-Q ...`). ledger.dlq is deliberately never consumed by
any worker - a dead-lettered task landing there shouldn't be picked back up
and re-executed as if it were a fresh delivery - so no worker ever declares
it. Run this once (before the workers start) to declare every queue in
task_queues, including ledger.dlq, without subscribing to any of them.
